          Flowbite is an open-source library of UI components built with the
          utility-first classes from Tailwind CSS. It also includes interactive
          elements such as dropdowns, modals, datepickers.

          Before going digital, you might benefit from scribbling down some
          ideas in a sketchbook. This way, you can think things through before
          committing to an actual design project.
        </p>
        <p>
          But then I found a <a href="https://flowbite.com"
            >component library based on Tailwind CSS called Flowbite</a
          >. It comes with the most commonly used UI components, such as
          buttons, navigation bars, cards, form elements, and more which are
          conveniently built with the utility classes from Tailwind CSS.
        </p>

        <h2>Getting started with Flowbite</h2>
        <p>
          First of all you need to understand how Flowbite works. This library
          is not another framework. Rather, it is a set of components based on
          Tailwind CSS that you can just copy-paste from the documentation.
        </p>
        <p>
          It also includes a JavaScript file that enables interactive
          components, such as modals, dropdowns, and datepickers which you can
          optionally include into your project via CDN or NPM.

            <strong>Usability testing</strong>. Does your user know how to exit
            out of screens? Can they follow your intended user journey and buy
            something from the site you’ve designed? By running a usability
            test, you’ll be able to see how users will interact with your design
            once it’s live;

          A typeface is a collection of letters. While each letter is unique,
          certain shapes are shared across letters. A typeface represents shared
          patterns across a collection of letters.
